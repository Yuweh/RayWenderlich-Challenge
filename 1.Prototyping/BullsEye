#1st APP: BullEye

My Answer
1. At the top most, there's a label that generates a randon number at the end of statment (ex. 55, up a 100)
2. There a slider from 0 to 100, then user could slide this and try to match it from the 1st
3. Place a button to check if the statement above and slider are matched
4. Bottom left, has a refresher button.
5. Next to refresher is a score and round label that displays previous score last game


In Comparison with Ray's Solution
He generated over 8 lines and most related about functions and how a certain line executes such function
He does this, algorithm list down before any project to break down the functionality of the app and have it managed as workable task

A lot more to learn XD
